# FEND Project 2 - Landing Page

This is my submission for the second project in Udacity's Front End Nanodegree program. I designed a web app landing page for a fictional travel company. 

## Main Project Requirements:

* build a multi-sectional, responsive landing page
* build a navigation system dynamically using an unordered via JavaScript
* highlight active sections

## Bonus Requirements:

I attempted some of the bonus requirements which included highlighting the active section in the navbar, hiding/showing the fixed navbar on scroll and creating my own layout.

### Still To Resolve

- **Vertical responsive images**
-- I used the object-fit property in css to help size the images but I'm not sure if this was the correct solution 
- **Smooth scroll in Nav**
-- would like to prevent the active state scroll through (from the forEach loop?) from triggering a scroll through the nav links and just highlight the current section.
- **Hero video**
-- I tried to include a still image from the video to show before the video loads, but I notice a jump from the other sections on browser refresh (would like to prevent this)
- **README/Markdown
-- This is my first, so hoping to learn more ðŸ˜Ž
